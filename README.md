## Description

This is an application designed to help a user search for a rescue dog based on their location. 

Users can also search by dog age, size and gender. 

* As a user, I want to be able to search for dogs near me, and then learn more about the breed of those dogs.

* We utilized PetFiner's API for our dog search. 

* NinjaDog's API to gather information about differnt dog breeds.

* We used jQueary in out javascript.

* we used Bulma's css library to style our application. 


## Usage
